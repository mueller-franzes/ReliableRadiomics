# This is an example of settings that can be used as a starting point for analyzing MR data with small (~3mm) slice
# thickness. This is only intended as a starting point and is not likely to be the optimal settings for your dataset.
# Some points in determining better values are added as comments where appropriate

# When adapting and using these settings for an analysis, be sure to add the PyRadiomics version used to allow you to
# easily recreate your extraction at a later timepoint:

setting:
  # Normalization:
  # MR signal is usually relative, with large differences between scanners and vendors. By normalizing the image before
  # feature calculation, this confounding effect may be reduced. However, if only one specific scanner is used, or the
  # images reflect some absolute world value (e.g. ADC maps, T2maps (NOT T2 weighted)), consider disabling the
  # normalization.

  # Normalization already done for training 
  # normalize: true
  # normalizeScale: 100  # This allows you to use more or less the same bin width.

  # Resampling:
  # If slices are very thin (~1mm), such as in 3D scanned (isotropic) volumes, resampledPixelSpacing may be reduced to
  # (1, 1, 1). Furthermore, in case of isotropic volumes, consider disabling resampling.
  # On a side note: increasing the resampled spacing forces PyRadiomics to look at more coarse textures, which may or
  # may not increase accuracy and stability of your extracted features.
  interpolator: 'sitkBSpline'
  resampledPixelSpacing: [2, 2, 2]

  # Mask validation:
  # correctMask and geometryTolerance are not needed, as both image and mask are resampled, if you expect very small
  # masks, consider to enable a size constraint by uncommenting settings below:
  #minimumROIDimensions: 2
  #minimumROISize: 50

  # Image discretization:
  # The ideal number of bins is somewhere in the order of 16-128 bins. A possible way to define a good binwidt is to
  # extract firstorder:Range from the dataset to analyze, and choose a binwidth so, that range/binwidth remains approximately
  # in this range of bins.
  binWidth: 10 # All scans are in range [-0.5, 0.5] => (500--500)/10=100bins , Default (300--300)/5 = 120bins

  # first order specific settings:
  # When normalizing, gray values below the mean will be negative. Shifting by 300 (3 StdDevs * 100) ensures that the
  # majority of voxels is positive (only outliers >3 SD lower than the mean will be negative).
  voxelArrayShift: 500  # Minimum value in HU is -500, shift +500 to prevent negative values from being squared.

  # Misc:
  # default label value. Labels can also be defined in the call to featureextractor.execute, as a commandline argument,
  # or in a column "Label" in the input csv (batchprocessing)

  # 2D:
  force2D: True # Set to True to force a by slice texture calculation. If input ROI is already a 2D ROI, features are automatically extracted in 2D
  # force2DDimension: 0 # [0]: int, range 0-2. Specifies the 'slice' dimension for a by-slice feature extraction. Value 0 identifies the 'z' dimension
